                2. Terms of participation

                2.1.4. During each Cleinsight Registration Process prospective Members will
                be notified of any terms in addition to these Terms which shall apply to

                2.1.5. You have to be 16 years or older to join the Cleinsight Panel.
                2.2.Information you provide to us
                2.2.1. In return for Cleinsight granting you access to the Cleinsight WebPages
                and/or the ability to participate in a Cleinsight Panel or Cleinsight Activity,
                you agree to:
                2.2.1.1. Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about
                yourself as prompted by the Cleinsight Registration Process;
                2.2.1.2. Maintain and promptly update your personal membership details
                including the Panel Membership Profile (defined below) so as to keep it true,
                accurate, current and complete; and
                2.2.1.3. Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about
                yourself as prompted by Cleinsight whilst participating in a Cleinsight Panel
                or Cleinsight Activity.
                2.2.2. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current,
                incomplete or inconsistent with prior answers to identical questions, or
                Cleinsight has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue,
                inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Cleinsight has the right to suspend or
                terminate your current access to, use of, and/or participation in the Cleinsight
                Panel or Cleinsight Activities.
                2.3.Your Panel Membership Profile and Cleinsight Account
                2.3.1.     Once they have completed the Cleinsight Registration Process,
                Members can be provided with a profile ("Panel Membership Profile") and an
                account ("Cleinsight Account") for the Cleinsight Panel and those Cleinsight
                Activities for which Points and/or Rewards (as defined below) are awarded.
                2.3.2.     Only one Profile is permitted per Member for the Cleinsight Panel
                and only one Cleinsight Account is permitted per Member for the Cleinsight
                Panel for which Points are awarded. Any Member found to have multiple
                Panel Membership Profiles and/or Cleinsight Accounts may have their primary
                and any secondary Panel Membership Profiles and/or Cleinsight Accounts
                deleted. Points earned via secondary Cleinsight Accounts may not be
                transferred. Cleinsight may demand proof of identity in the event of a
                dispute.
                2.3.3.     A unique email address must be used by each Member. (For
                example, this means that family members may not each have an account
                using a shared email address but must each have a separate account with a
                separate email address.)
                2.3.4.     Each Panel Membership Profile and Cleinsight Account must only be
                accessed by an individual Member, and may not be accessed by any other
                individual without the express permission and authorization of Cleinsight. You
                agree to notify Cleinsight immediately you become aware of or suspect any
                unauthorized use of your login information, Panel Membership Profile and/or
                Cleinsight Account, or any other breach of security.
                2.3.5.     In the event of access to your Cleinsight Account by another
                individual, Cleinsight reserves the right to suspend your and/or that other
                individual’s account until a resolution has been reached. Cleinsight reserves
                the right to reclaim any Points or other incentives earned by access of the
                unauthorized user.
                2.3.6.     Members may earn points for their Cleinsight Account ("Points") in
                the prescribed manner detailed on the Cleinsight WebPages or partner pages,
                including for completing the Cleinsight Registration Process and for
                participating in the Cleinsight Panel and related Cleinsight Activities for which
                Points are awarded. The number of points that can be earned for participation
                in a Cleinsight Panel or related Cleinsight Activity will be notified to Members
                via authorized communications.
                2.3.7.     Unless otherwise specifically notified, Points can only be earned
                through following all and any instructions regarding earning Points. A
                Member's failure to correctly follow any required instructions or procedures
                may result in no Points being earned.
                2.3.8.     Points earned will be recorded in your Cleinsight Account, however,
                no Points earned are ever available for redemption until the Member has
                (subject to paragraph 2.3.9 below) reached the specified fulfilment level
                advertised, together with details of the applicable reward(s) available, in the
                Account section of the Website. If Cleinsight has suspended or terminated
                your Cleinsight Account for any of the reasons outlined in these Terms no
                Points that you have earned can be redeemed.
                2.3.9.     Cleinsight reserves the right to change the range of Cleinsight
                Activities and the Cleinsight Panel or related Cleinsight Activities for which
                Members may be eligible for Points and to vary the frequency of invitation to
                such activities. Cleinsight also reserves the right to alter the level of Points
                required before such Points can be redeemed.
                2.3.10.     Points may not be transferred to other Cleinsight Accounts nor
                pooled together in any manner and the sale or barter of Points is strictly
                prohibited. Points have no monetary value, and cannot be used for any
                purpose other than redeeming the designated reward.
                2.3.11.         Cleinsight may from time to time adjust a Member's Cleinsight
                Account upwards or downwards in response to errors which Members
                acknowledge may arise or suspected fraud, for which we have full authority.
                2.3.12.     Cleinsight reserves the right to terminate any Cleinsight Account
                that has been dormant for a period of 12 months or more. By ‘dormant’ we
                mean, where the Member has not participated in the Cleinsight Panel or any
                related Cleinsight Activity within the preceding 12 month period. Cleinsight
                will attempt to contact the Member, via their nominated email address, if
                their Cleinsight Account is at risk of termination through inactivity. In the
                absence of a satisfactory response, the Cleinsight Account will be terminated,
                and any unused Points will be forfeited.
                2.4. Survey invitations
                2.4.1.     You acknowledge that:
                2.4.1.1     if you register to the Cleinsight, it is integral to your participation
                that we are able to send you emails and notifications inviting you to
                participate in surveys for research projects, whether via the Website or App
                or in person; and
                2.4.1.2     if you wish to stop receiving such emails and notifications, you may
                terminate your membership in accordance with paragraph 6.1 of these
                Terms.
                3. Prize polls
                3.1.     Cleinsight may ask you to participate in Cleinsight Activities where you
                can redeem the points or rewards after reaching a certain threshold.
                4. Referral Links
                4.1.     You may be able to earn extra Points by referring friends and family to
                the Cleinsight Panel, provided they join using a unique link that we provide to
                you for making referrals (“Referral Link”). The conditions attached to the
                awarding of such extra Points are explained in the Account section of the
                Website and App. When referring new panel Members, you agree to not pose
                as or claim to represent Cleinsight and you will not attempt to mislead or
                deceive prospective Members into using your Referral Link to join. You agree
                to make clear to any prospective Members you refer that they will be using
                your unique Referral Link and that you will receive Points if they join the
                Cleinsight panel via your Referral Link.
                5. User Content
                5.1.     Use of the Cleinsight WebPages and participation in Cleinsight
                Activities or the Cleinsight Panel may involve you submitting survey
                responses and other content to us ("User Content") which may be visible to
                other users of the Cleinsight WebPages.
                5.2.     You acknowledge that User Content provided by you is your sole
                responsibility. This means that you, and not Cleinsight, are entirely
                responsible for all User Content you upload, post, link to, email or otherwise
                transmit via your use of the Cleinsight WebPages or your participation in any
                of the Cleinsight Activities or the Cleinsight Panel.
                5.3.     Cleinsight does not control or pre-screen the User Content posted or
                questions asked on the Cleinsight WebPages and does not guarantee the
                accuracy, integrity or quality of such User Content, and therefore assumes no
                liability in respect of the User Content.
                5.4.     You understand that by using the Cleinsight WebPages, you may be
                exposed to User Content, and you agree that you must evaluate, and bear, all
                risks associated with the use of any User Content, including any reliance on
                its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. Notwithstanding the foregoing
                Cleinsight shall have the right in their sole discretion to refuse, edit, move or
                remove any such User Content, whether or not that content violates these
                Terms.
                5.5.     With respect to all User Content you elect to transmit to us (including
                User Content you post on the Cleinsight WebPages), you grant Cleinsight a
                royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive licence (with the right to
                sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, translate, create
                derivative works from, exploit, perform and display such User Content (in

                any form, media or technology now known or later developed, for any
                purposes.
                5.6.     In the course of using the Cleinsight WebPages and/or participating in

                likely to cause distress, intended to incite hatred or is otherwise objectionable
                as determined by us in our sole discretion;

                5.6.5.     Upload, post, link to, or otherwise transmit any information that you

                6. Terminating your membership
                6.1.     If you no longer wish to be a Member please contact Cleinsight.
                Cleinsight will terminate your account and cease to contact you within 30
                days of receiving notice from you that you wish to terminate your
                membership. You therefore acknowledge and agree that if you terminate
                your membership you may receive emails from Cleinsight for a period of 30
                days after the date of your notice. If you decide to terminate using the
                ‘Unsubscribe’ option on your Cleinsight Account page, you will retain any
                Points previously earned, you will cease to receive emails and notifications
                from Cleinsight and be unable to participate in the Cleinsight Panel or in any
                Cleinsight Activities unless and until you reactivate your Cleinsight Account. If
                you request the erasure of your Cleinsight Account you will forfeit all Points
                previously earned and be unable to reactivate your Cleinsight Account. We
                will erase all records as requested except to the extent local law requires
                retention of certain data in connection with business record retention
                requirements.
                6.2.     You agree that Cleinsight, in its sole discretion, may terminate or

                Activities or the Cleinsight Panel, or remove or discard any User Content, for
                any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use, or if Cleinsight
                believed that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit
                of these Terms.
                6.3.     You agree that Cleinsight may terminate your access to Cleinsight
                Activities or the Cleinsight Panel under any provision of these Terms without
                notice, and acknowledge and agree that Cleinsight may immediately
                deactivate your registration as a Member and/or bar access to Cleinsight
                Activities and the Cleinsight Panel. Further, you agree that Cleinsight shall
                not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to

                suffers or incurs resulting in any way from your use of the Cleinsight

                Cleinsight Activities or the Cleinsight Panel or resulting from any breach of
                these Terms whether such breach is carried out by you or by any other
                person through your Panel Membership Profile or Cleinsight Account as a
                result of your negligence.

                trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, database rights and trade
                secrets contained therein. The compilation, organization and display of the
                content, as well as all software and inventions used on and in connection with

                expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not modify, copy, reproduce,
                create derivative works, republish, display, upload, post, transmit, distribute
                or use in any way content available on the Website or App without the prior
                written consent of Cleinsight.
                10. Other important terms
                10.1.     Notices relating to these Terms. All notices given by Cleinsight to
                Members will be sent to their designated email address provided by them
                during the Cleinsight Registration Process.
                10.2    If a court finds part of these Terms illegal or otherwise invalid, the rest
                will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates
                separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are
                unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
                10.3    Reliance on these Terms. We intend to rely on these written Terms
                and any document expressly referred to in them in relation to the subject
                matter of any agreement between us. We and you will be legally bound by
                these Terms.
                10.4    Events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If we are
                prevented or delayed from complying with our obligations under these Terms
                by anything you (or anyone acting on your behalf) does or fails to do or due
                to events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, our inability or
                delay in performing our obligations will not be deemed to be in breach of
                these Terms. Examples of such events and circumstances include fire, flood
                and other acts of God, strikes, trade disputes, lockouts, restrictions of imports
                or exports, riot, accident, disruption to energy supplies, civil commotion, acts
                of terrorism or war.
                10.5    References to ‘including’ and other similar expressions. In these
                Terms, words that appear after the expression ‘include’, ‘including’, ‘other’,
                ‘for example, ‘such as’ or ‘in particular (or any similar expression) will not
                limit the meaning of the words appearing before such expression.
                10.6    We may transfer this Agreement to someone else. We may transfer
                our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organization. We will
                use commercially reasonable efforts to contact you to let you know of such a
                transfer. If you are unhappy with the transfer you may contact us to end your
                membership within 14 days of us telling you about the transfer.
                10.7    You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else. You
                may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to
                another person if we agree to this in writing.
                10.8    Nobody else has any rights under these Terms. The agreement made
                under these Terms is between you and us. No other person shall have any
                right to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement
                of any other person in order to end the agreement between us or to make
                any changes to these Terms.
                10.9    Language. These Terms may be presented to you in more than one
                language. However, the English language version of these Terms shall
                prevail. Any agreement between us will be concluded in English.
                10.10 Even if we delay in enforcing a Contract, we can still enforce it later. If
                we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do
                under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of
                your breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do
                those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later
                date.
                10.11 The laws that apply to these Terms, where you may bring legal
                proceedings and class action waiver.
                This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the
                laws of Singapore, the principal place of business of Cleinsight, without giving
                effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree to bring any claims
                against Cleinsight, exclusively in the courts of Singapore. WHERE PERMITTED
                UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND Cleinsight AGREE THAT EACH MAY
                BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
                CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
                CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Cleinsight agree,
                no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or
                otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
